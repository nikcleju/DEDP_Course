    "Taking a single sample of the signal we obtain a value $r$:\n",

    "# Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simulate threshold-based detection with a single sample, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Generate a vector of 100000 values $0$ or $A$, with equal probability (consider $A = 5$)\n",
    "    - Add over it a random noise with normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2=1)$\n",
    "    - Pick a value of $T$ between $0$ and $A$, and compare each element with $T$ to decide which sample is logical 0 or logical 1 (A)\n",
    "    - Compare the decision result with the true original vector, and count how many correct detections and how may false alarms have been\n",
    "    * Estimate P(hit) and P(false alarm) by dividing the above numbers to the size of the vector\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Wrap the above code into a function  `[phit, pfa] =  myThreshDet(T)` that returns\n",
    "the two probabilities for a given `T`. Draw the ROC by running the function for 100 values of $T$ uniformly\n",
    "spaced between $0$ and $A$, and plotting the resulting vector `phit` against `pfa`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Repeat the simulation for BPSK modulation, as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Generate a vector of 100000 values $0$ or $A$, with equal probability (consider $A = 5$)\n",
    "    - Generate a signal `p` with 1 period of a sinusoidal signal, of length 100 samples.\n",
    "    - Generate the BPSK modulated signal `s`. Use `kron()` for this, explain at whiteboard.\n",
    "    - Add over it a random noise with normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2=1)$. Call the result `r`.\n",
    "    - Plot the signals `s` and `r` on the same figure (original signal and noisy signal)\n",
    "    - Do BPSK de-modulation as follows:\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "      rs = p * reshape(r, 100,[]);\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    - The vector `rs` is similar to the `r` vector from the previous exercise. Continue in the same way as in the previous exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Repeat the same simulation in Exercise 1 for two samples per bit:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - double the values of the starting vector, making two consecutive $0$ or $A$ values, e.g. $$[0 0 A A 0 0 A A A A 0 0 A A ...]$$\n",
    "    - the decision now uses **the average  value** of the two consecutive samples of a bit\n",
    "    - plot the ROC and compare with the first one. Which is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Final questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Suppose we make we start with a vector with much fewer 1's than 0's. Should we increase or decrease the threshold $T$?\n",
    "2. In a practical scenario, what could be a disadvantage of using 2 samples for detection, compared to just 1?"
