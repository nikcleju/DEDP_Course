1. Let $A$ be a continuous r.v. with distribution $\mathcal{U} \; [0, 6]$
    a. Draw the PDF of A
    b. Compute the probability that $A > 1$
    c. Compute the probability that $A \in (0,2)$
    d. Draw the CDF function and write its mathematical expression
    e. What is the distribution of $B = A-2$?
    f. What is the distribution of $C = 3*A$?

2. Let $A$ be a r.v. with distribution $\mathcal{N} \; \left(\mu=1, \sigma^2=20\right)$.
    a. Compute the probability that $A \in [2, 4]$
    b. What is the distribution of $B = A-2$?
    c. What is the maximum value of $w_A(x)$ and for what $x$ is it reached?
    d. (**) What is the distribution of $C = 3*A$?

3. Knowing that the IQ score follows a distribution $\mathcal{N} \; \left(\mu=100, \sigma=15\right)$, find:

    a. The probability that a random person has IQ score > 130
    b. If the total population is 8 billion, how many people have IQ smaller than 75
    c. (**) What is the minimum IQ needed in order to be among the top 2%?

4. Let $A$ be a **discrete** random variable with possible values $\left\lbrace 0, 1, 2, \dots 10 \right\rbrace$,
all values having equal probability.

    a. Draw the distribution (PMF) of $A$
    a. Find the probability that $A \in [3, 7]$
    b. What is the probability that $A$ is an odd number?

7. Compute the probability that three r.v. $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ i.i.d. $\mathcal{N}(-1,1)$
are all positive simultaneously

1. Compute the probability that at least one of three r.v. $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ i.i.d. $\mathcal{N}(-1,1)$
is positive.

1. Compute the average value, the average squared value, and the variance
for a continuous random variable with the uniform distribution $\mathcal{U}[2,10]$.
