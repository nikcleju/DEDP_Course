1. Let $A$ be a continuous r.v. with distribution $\mathcal{U} \; [0, \pi]$
    a. Draw the PDF of A
    a. Compute the probability that $A > 1$
    a. Compute the probability that $A \in (0,2)$
    a. Draw the CDF function and write its mathematical expression
    a. What is the distribution of $B = A-2$?

2. Let $A$ be a r.v. with distribution $\mathcal{N} \; \left(\mu=1, \sigma^2=2\right)$. 
    a. Compute the probability that $A \in [2, 4]$
    a. What is the distribution of $B = A-2$? 
    a. What is the maximum value of $w_A(x)$ and for what $x$ is it reached?

1. Let $A$ be a **discrete** random variable with uniform distribution $\mathcal{U}\;[0,10]$
    a. How many different realizations of $A$ are possible?
    a. Draw the PMF of $A$

2. Compute the probability that three r.v. $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ i.i.d. $\mathcal{N}(-1,1)$
are all positive simultaneously

3. Consider 3 three normal random variables $A \sim \mathcal{N}\; \left(\mu=1, \sigma^2=3\right)$,
 $B \sim \mathcal{N}\; \left(\mu=-4, \sigma^2=3\right)$, $C \sim \mathcal{N}\; \left(\mu=5, \sigma^2=3\right)$.
     a. Is it more likely that $(A,B,C)$ has values around $(2, -6, 3)$ or around $(-2, -3, 2)$?
     b. Find a set of values $(x,y,z)$ such that $(A,B,C)$ are as likely to be in a vicinity
     of $(x, y, z)$ as in a vicinity of $(2, -6, 3)$.
     
1. Compute the average value, the average squared value, and the variance
for a continuous random variable with the uniform distribution $\mathcal{U}[2,10]$.
